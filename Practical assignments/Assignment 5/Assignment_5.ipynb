    "## **Notebook Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tackles the three core problems for the fifth practical assignment. We will use the ratings dataset to perform probability calculations and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Tasks to be Performed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task 1: Probability of Evaluation Score > 4.5**\n",
    "    We will calculate the probability of receiving an evaluation score greater than 4.5 using the teachers' rating dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task 2: Probability of Score Between 3.5 and 4.2**\n",
    "    We will calculate the probability of receiving an evaluation score greater than 3.5 and less than 4.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task 3: Two-Tailed Hypothesis Test**\n",
    "    We will perform a two-tailed test from a normal distribution to compare professional basketball team performance with regional league players. We will state the null and alternative hypotheses and conduct the statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **General Instructions & Setup**\n",
    "As per the assignment requirements, this notebook will adhere to the following:\n",
    "1. The ratings dataset will be used for probability calculations.\n",
    "2. A normal distribution two-tailed test will be performed for hypothesis testing.\n",
    "3. All statistical tests include proper interpretations and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Let's begin with the Environment setup and move to the problems.*\n",
